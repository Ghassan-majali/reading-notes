## Techniques That offer a Wider choice of Typefaces:

*The font-family property should hold several font names as a "fallback" system, to ensure maximum compatibility between browsers/operating systems. Start with the font you want, and end with a generic family (to let the browser pick a similar font in the generic family, if no other fonts are available). The font names should be separated with comma.*

example : .p1 {
  font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
}

- *font-size : to specify a size for the font.* 
- *font-face : allows you to use a font, even if it is not installed on the computer of the person browsing, by allowing you to specify a path to a copy of the font, which will be downloaded if it is not on the user's machine.*
- *font-weight : to create bold text.*
- *font-style : three values this property can take:(normal, italic, oblique)*
- *text-transform : used to change the case of text giving it one of the following values (uppercase, lowercase, capitalize)*
- *text-decoration : under line and strike ( none, underline, overline, line-through, blink)*
- *text-align : to control the alignment of text. The property can take one of four values:(left, right, center, justify)*
- *text-indent : to indent the first line of text within an element.
- *text-shadow : to create a drop shadow, which is a dark version of the word just behind it and slightly offset.*
