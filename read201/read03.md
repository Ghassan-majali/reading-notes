**control the dimension of a box-size width ,height**

- The most popular ways to specify the size of a box are to use pixels, percentages, or ems. Traditionally, pixels have been the most popular method because they allow designers to accurately control their size

## From the Duckett JS book:

*-Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next.*
*-Data types can be coerced from one type to another.*
*-Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands.*
*-Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.*
*-if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false.*
*-There are three types of loop: for, while, and do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.*
*-All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.*
*-switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match).*
