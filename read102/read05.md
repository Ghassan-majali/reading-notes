programmers often rely upon the following three concepts:
EVALUATIONS :
You can analyze values in your scripts to determine whether or note they match expected results.

DECISIONS : Using the results of evaluations, you can decide which path your script should go down.

LOOPS : There are also many occasions where you will want to perform the same set of steps repeatedly.
